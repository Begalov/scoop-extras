The "cg" bucket for [Scoop](http://scoop.sh), for anything of Computer Graphic and that doesn't fit the [criteria](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop/wiki/Criteria-for-including-apps-in-the-main-bucket) for inclusion in the [main bucket](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Main).

To make it easier to install apps from this bucket, run
